In staarter.dev, we provide a set of generators to help you scaffold new features, components, and pages quickly. These generators are designed to streamline your development process and ensure consistency across your project.

## Available Generators

Here are some of the generators available in staarter.dev:

- `web/page`: Generates a new page component with a corresponding route.
- `web/component`: Generates a new React component.
- `api/procedure`: Generates a new tRPC procedure with the correct type and permission scope.
- `auth/provider`: Generates a new OAuth provider configuration.
- `mailing/email`: Generates a new email template.

## Using Generators

To use a generator, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
turbo gen
```

This command will prompt you to select a generator from the list of available options. Once you choose a generator, you will be guided through a series of questions to configure the generated files.
